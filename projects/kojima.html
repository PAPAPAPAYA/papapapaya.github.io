			The player starts to notice something different when “Psycho Mantis,” one of the enemy characters in the video game Metal Gear Solid (MGS), says he can read the player’s mind. He demonstrates his psychic power and starts talking about what video games the player likes. He asks the player to put down the controller and claims that he can move it. After the player puts down the controller, it starts to move slowly. This enemy can dodge any move the player makes because he can “read” the input the player gives through the interface. The only way to defeat this enemy is to unplug the controller from the PlayStation console and plug it into another USB interface, then the “Psycho Mantis” will lose his mind-reading ability. These are all only little gimmicks that Hideo Kojima utilized with the possibilities that the video game platform enables: the game reads the saved data on the video game console that the player is using and sees what games are played the most; the vibrator on the controller is programmed to vibrate so that it looks like it’s moving. By doing so MGS acknowledges that there is a player playing a video game, and thus breaks the fourth wall.

		<p>
			But how can a medium that is focusing so much on immersion allow such self-revelation? How is this, to use a theatrical term, alienation effect, not breaking the immersion, but rather, enhancing it? And how does this complex revelation of one’s agency in relation to the game not cutting off the connection between the player and the player character?
		</p>
		<p>
			Breaking the fourth wall is not an unusual technique in narrative media, yet what Kojima did with video games is different than in other media, or other video games. Breaking the fourth wall is often time used for comedic effect, thus it is common in many comedy movies or plays. Addressing the audience directly can also help educate necessary background knowledge, such examples can be seen in the movie The Big Short (2015), a movie about the 08’ financial crisis, where characters would turn to the camera and explain difficult economic terms and concepts.  A famous example of such a technique in the video game domain is The Stanley Parable (2013), a meta-game which constantly acknowledges the existence of the player and comments on the form of video game and the player. Hideo Kojima is not passionate about discussing the medium of video games but is interested to use this medium for narrative exploration, and a good story should be immersive and believable for the player to suspend their disbelief. It seems this is what Hideo Kojima is using with all the fourth-wall-breaking designs, he somehow immerses his viewers and tests the limits of their immersion with designs that reminds the player that he or she is playing a video game.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, in the famous boss fight (a summative encounter of challenge placed throughout the process of a video game) with “Psycho Mantis”, Kojima breaks the fourth wall to create an atmosphere that is surprising and unrealistic and is yet reasonable due to the sci-fi theme of the game. To showcase a tough enemy character with mind-reading ability, a game, of course, can have him or her  read out the player character’s secrets and move objects in the game space, yet Kojima makes the enemy character “read” the player’s secrets and “move” objects in reality, in the player’s domestic space/player’s own home. Having the player be the object for showcasing the ability and settings of “Psycho Mantis” instead of the player character helps dodge the decrease of dramatic effect due to the gap between the player and the player character. The similar design can be seen in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (MGS3). In the boss fight with the enemy character “The End”, who is dying due to his high age, one of the solutions of defeating him is to turn off the game console for two weeks. After booting up the console again, the player character will find “The End” has died. It also creates an unexpected but reasonable experience, and it is a creative way to test the player’s imagination and if the player paid attention to the information given. However, if we start to look at the fourth-wall-breaking designs in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (MGS2), things can not be explained this easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			In MGS2, as the protagonist, “Raiden”, is revealed later in the game to be participating in a simulated situation by AIs, when the game talks to the player, in a sense the fourth wall is not broken. For example, in a radio conversation, an AI character says: “Raiden, turn the game console off right now!” and tries to stop Raiden to proceed by telling him that it is only a video game, nothing really matters. It creates a complicated experience because as the protagonist is playing a virtual mission, he is very similar to the player who is sitting in front of the TV playing a video game. MGS2 managed to comment and reflect on the medium form, the series of Metal Gear and even the audience without being a metagame. And what’s the most interesting about this design is that it is something only video game can do because video game is an interactive medium.
		</p>
		<p>
			Being an interactive medium, games can’t be finished before it is played, therefore there is a premise to every game: a player. Often time a game won’t acknowledge the existence of a player in the narrative so I feel like when Hideo Kojima does this all the time, they are not simple fourth-wall-breaking tricks but belong to a greater design scheme. And this is tied to Hideo Kojima’s love for cinema.  Hideo Kojima was born into a family that loves cinema. “It was during that time that my parents introduced a family tradition: every night we would all watch a film together. I wasn’t allowed to go to bed till the film had finished: the opposite of how it is for most children,” Kojima once said in an interview with Simon Parkin from The Guardian. He wanted to become a film director but because the nearest film school was so far away and the Japanese film industry only had a low budget, he chose to work on video games in Konami, a video game company,  instead. However, his love and ambition for the film didn’t die, instead, he was thinking about using the medium of video game to realize his vision for cinema. “I make games. That’s what I do,” said Kojima, “so I think about ways that I can use the game systems to reinforce my story or do things that simply aren’t possible in other media” (Parkin). This may be the key to understanding why his games often give the player the feeling of being sucked in and dragged out by subverting the form of a video game.
		</p>
		<p>
			In his essay, “‘A Man Chooses, a Slave Obeys’: Agency, Interactivity, and Freedom in Video Gaming,” Rowan Tulloch talks about how most single-player video games can only afford the player limited “range of potential play practices”, as “game development resources are always finite” (10). More importantly, game designers want to have control of the game space as they are “looking to create a specific kind of experience for the player”. The designers find a way to do that by providing a new set of tools or teaching them a new language for the player to communicate with the game: “Many video games take on a pedagogic relationship to the player. They train the player to play in specific ways” (Tulloch). In a game, the player is taught to use the logic in the game rather than common knowledge in the real world, and this process can be found in every game. As this process is often shown in the form of “tutorial”, a session at the beginning of a game that teaches the player how to play, the player will consider what the video game has taught him or she is the rule and the truth in the game world. This starts to sound like a commitment that the game is giving to the player: if the player obeys the rules taught in the pedagogical process, he or she will get the experience promised by the game. This commitment also includes “lessons” that are taught outside the game, but by the tradition of the video game industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now if we look at the fourth-wall-breaking designs again with this new perspective, we can see why Hideo Kojima is never breaking the immersion but is rather playing on the commitment and the expectation of the player. In the boss fight with “Psycho Mantis”, Hideo Kojima is asking the player to solve the puzzle as “the player” rather “the character”. The design of this enemy character is breaking the commitment of using guns to take down enemy character that is taught in the pedagogic process, as at the beginning of the game, it teaches the player how to use the tranquility gun to take down enemies. It is asking the player to bring in common knowledge, which is a powerful toolset that, often times, is taught by the game not to use them. This breaking of rules is backed back the narrative of the game: The game features a supernatural theme that having a mind-reading character who can affect real-life objects seems reasonable. And as the character truly shows the power that can affect the real world, the narrative of the game becomes more believable, thus creates immersion for the player. The player is getting dragged out by the game as it breaks the fourth wall, the tradition of video game and what it teaches in the pedagogical process, but turns out to be sucked in as this breaking the fourth wall is contained inside the game world and it seems so reasonable to the player as it is in accordance with common knowledge. The similar analysis can be applied to the mentioned boss fight with “the End” as Hideo Kojima deliberately set up the context of “time” because first, the game has real-time day and night shifts, and second provides an important detail of “the End” being really old. With these protections in the narrative level to contain the immersion, Kojima subverts the commitment and asks the player to think like a normal person rather than a character in the game. He is not dragging the player out from the virtual game world back to the reality, but rather invading the reality by breaking the fourth wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			To further utilize this framework on Hideo Kojima’s works, we should then expand the focus not only on four-wall-breaking but also on the edges where reality and virtuality meet and bleed into each other. In MGS2, Raiden will encounter Snake, a character who enables a cheat code from the former game in the series to give himself “infinite ammo”. Cheat codes are a tradition of the video game industry which are secret codes that changes the rules of the game, often making it easier. These codes are never considered to be part of the actual games, not to mention the narrative. In the surface, it is telling the player “you are only playing a video game” and breaks the story and the immersion; However, Kojima used it to enhance the story because MGS2 is about the protagonist loses his identity between reality and the virtuality. Not only the “cheat code”, other parts of a video game that help sewing the reality of the player and the virtuality of the game together are interfaces such as a health bar, which indicates the player character’s hit point or status and menus that let the player adjust various settings, like the graphics, sounds, or control schemes. In MGS2, the player must access the menu by controlling Raiden, the player character, to access a terminal machine inside the game space. This design again plays on the player’s immersion as he or she usually access the menu by pausing the game and suspending the immersion, and yet he or she can’t in MGS2. The player’s virtuality is questioned when the game asks the player to stay in immersion even when he or she is operating the game on a meta level.
		</p>
		<p>
			A more interesting example can be found in MGS3 where the player can rotate the character model in a menu to inspect the player character, and if the player keeps rotating the character will vomit due to the “dizziness” caused by the rotation. The reality of the character takes the form of common knowledge and blends with the player’s virtuality in the game. This complication is enhanced when the player character gets food poisoned and the player finds that he or she can deal with this negative effect by getting the character vomit in the menu. Again, the player’s immersion is tricked and complicated as Hideo Kojima blends and “misplaces” parts of the game that are not meant to be experienced with immersion when the menu and affect the actual game.
		</p>
		<p>
			This misplacing of elements and breaking the rules taught by the game is everywhere. In MGS3, the player is first taught to transition between first-person perspective and third-person perspective so that the player can aim and observe the environment more efficiently. On the other hand, cut-scenes are part of the game that doesn’t require aiming and observation. In fact, according to Paul Cheng in his essay “Waiting for Something to Happen: Narratives, Interactivity and Agency and the Video Game Cut-scene”, “the cut-scene then becomes the locus of the tension in video games between cinematic representation and gameplay”, and “this supposed lack of activity…causes many theorists to characterize the cut-scene as moments of passivity within the larger interactive structure of the game”. This proves that cut-scenes in video games are “promised” by designers and is a tradition of the video game industry to be separated from the actual game. Hideo Kojima subverts this expectation of the player as the transition of perspective is still performable in cutscenes. When a cut-scene shows the protagonist of MGS3 stands in front of the grave of his respective mentor who is killed by the protagonist, if the player transitions to the first-person perspective, he or she can see the protagonist’s eyes are blurred by tears. This enriches the characterization of the protagonist as when the player views him in the third person perspective he is shown as a hard-boiled and cold-hearted solder, and this subversion of rules of cut-scenes allows the player to actively discover a more complex and loveable character. The similar design technique is used in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (MGS4). Towards the end, the protagonist who is old and weak needs to crawl through a heavily irradiated tunnel to save the world. Even though it is shown in a cut-scene, the player needs to constantly press a button to finish the mission as the protagonist is struggling and keeps falling and the player needs to control him to proceed. This subversion of cut-scene is furthered as it even shows the health bar and stamina bar of the protagonist. At first, the health bar starts to decrease due to the heavy radiation in the tunnel, after the bar is drained and according to the pedagogical process the protagonist should be dead, the game should be over, and the player should leave immersion and operate in a menu outside the actual game. However, the player needs to continue pressing the button and the protagonist will get up again. This time the stamina bar, which indicates the protagonist’s mental strength in the game, starts to decrease. Several rules are broken and subverted: the separation between cutscenes and the actual game, the expectation of game over, the indication of the stamina bar, etc. These subversions are all supposed to drag the player out of the immersion, nevertheless, they turn out to enhance the empathetic effect between the protagonist and the player.
		</p>
		<p>
			To take a step further and consider this on an even bigger scale, a very basic rule of a video game is also subverted, which is the avatar of the player. It is a tradition that advertising is supposed to not show fake information about the produce, and MGS2 breaks this tradition. With commercials and box arts, MGS2 promised the player that he or she can play as “Snake”, a cool and professional soldier. Yet it turns out that the protagonist is “Raiden”, a rookie with anime-like silver hair and makes silly mistakes. This, of course, is again enhancing the theme of MGS2 as mentioned, but this time the subversion began even before the game is played. What the player experienced is dramatically changed because of the advertisement and trailers before the game is released, and this is also relevant to the theme of the game as MGS2 also talks about manipulation through digital information.  This play on the player’s expectation of the character is also in Hideo Kojima’s newest video game in the series Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (MGSV). The whole game is a pedagogical process that teaches the player that he or she is playing as “Big Boss”, a great enemy character that the player already defeated in earlier games, and MGSV would be the one in the series that explains how a patriotic soldier becomes a big villain. And at the end of the game, it is revealed in a tape titled “The Man Who Sold the World” that the protagonist was a nobody all the time, the player character is tricked by other characters while the player is tricked by Hideo Kojima. With this revelation, suddenly the player feels responsible for all the decisions he or she made in the game because the player is no longer a witness but the performer. By using the tradition and breaking it, the gap between the player character and the player is shortened.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a coda, we can see that Hideo Kojima is interested in exploring the boundary of video game’s virtuality. He utilizes designs like four-wall breaking, subverting tradition, and breaking rules set by the game to blur the boundary line between reality and virtuality, and ultimately creates a very immersive experience for the player. During the time when scholars created the studies of game, whether the video game is a narrative medium was debated and many considered that a major flaw in the medium is that the player may not be a good actor that cooperates with the game and immersive into the world to tell a good story. How should video games do narrative has been explored a lot, from using text in boxes to tell a story, to provide the cinematic scripted narrative. These approaches all successfully incorporated techniques and methods from other narrative media, which don’t require a participant to provide feedback, to help games tell story, yet Hideo Kojima has been facing but not avoiding the existence of the player and utilizes it as an advantage but not a disadvantage by bringing real-world logic into the game world and subverting the player’s expectation. When a player is thinking as “a player” rather than “the character”, he or she is not in the immersion; but when Hideo Kojima includes the parts when the player is thinking as “a player” in the game world and its narrative, he successfully expands the boundary of the immersion. When people find out there is an unreachable ending in MGSV by extracting the game file which indicates the unreachable true peace in the real world, I believe Hideo Kojima will continue to expand the boundary of video game and takes us to a new level of immersion by eliminating the gap between the virtuality and the reality.
